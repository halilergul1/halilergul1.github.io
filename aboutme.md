title: About me
---

My name is Halil İbrahim Ergül, a Senior Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer currently at OLX, with a passion for building intelligent, data-driven solutions that enhance user experiences. I specialize in the realms of search algorithms, ranking, vector embeddings, semantic search, recommendation systems, and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

### My Story

My journey in tech has allowed me to tackle fascinating challenges at the intersection of large-scale e-commerce, mobile applications, and academic research.

Before my current role at OLX, I was a Data Scientist on the Search Algorithm Team at **Hepsiburada**, one of Turkey's leading e-commerce platforms. There, I focused on improving search relevance and user engagement. Some of my key contributions include:
* Developing N-gram and topic extraction-based search suggestions, which drove a 10% increase in click-through rates and a 7% rise in order conversions.
* Improving search relevance with point-wise ranking experiments, resulting in an 11% gain in offline metrics.
* Designing and launching a "Related Search Term" feature using BERT and recommendation algorithms.

At the mobile app company **Upily**, I held roles as both a Data Scientist and an ML Engineer. My work involved building the foundational data infrastructure and deploying machine learning models into production. I built automated ETL pipelines to process millions of daily events, developed end-to-end ML models for churn prediction, improved user segmentation accuracy by 22%, and integrated an LLM assistant that optimized API response times by 30%.

My professional experience is complemented by a strong research background as a Research Assistant at the **Behavioral Analytics and Visualization Lab**. There, I worked on a TUBITAK-supported project using BERT models for Turkish sentiment detection and fine-tuned Large Language Models for behavior classification and summarization tasks.

I hold a Master of Science in Data Science from **Sabanci University**, where my thesis involved fine-tuning open-source LLMs to predict customer purchase behaviors. I began my academic journey with a BA in International Relations & Sociology from **Boğaziçi University**, graduating with High Honors and first in my cohort. This foundation gives me a unique perspective on understanding the human side of data.

I'm always excited to connect and discuss new ideas in machine learning and data science. Feel free to look at my work on [Github](https://github.com/halilergul1) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/halil-i-ergul/).
